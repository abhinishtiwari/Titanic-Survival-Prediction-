## Overview

Welcome to the **Titanic Survival Prediction** project! This project uses data science techniques, including **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and **Machine Learning Model Building**, to predict the survival of passengers on the RMS Titanic based on a variety of features.

The goal is to predict whether a passenger survived or not based on features like **Age, Sex, Class, Fare**, etc.

## 🎯 Key Features:

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: 
  - Clean the data and visualize the relationships between different features.
  - Handle missing data, outliers, and perform transformations to prepare for modeling.
  - Create insightful plots to reveal patterns and trends in the Titanic dataset.

- **Model Building**: 
  - Apply different machine learning algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest) to build a prediction model.
  - Tune the models using **hyperparameter optimization** to improve the model's performance.
  - Evaluate the model's accuracy using metrics such as **Accuracy**, **Cross-Validation (CV) Score**, and other evaluation techniques.

- **Dataset**: Titanic dataset from Kaggle's Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster competition.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used:

- Python (with libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)
- Jupyter Notebook
- ML algorithms: Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest

## 📊 Steps Taken:

### 1. **Data Preprocessing**: 
   - **Loading & cleaning the data**
   - Dealing with **missing values**
   - Encoding categorical variables (e.g., Sex, Embarked)
   - Feature Engineering

### 2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: 
   - Visualizing **survival rates** across different features.
   - Exploring relationships between features like **Age**, **Fare**, **Pclass**, **Sex**, and survival status.


### 3. **Model Building**:
   - Applying **Logistic Regression**, **Random Forest**, and **Decision Trees** to the data.
   - Hyperparameter tuning and evaluating model performance.


### 4. **Model Evaluation**:
   - **Accuracy**
   - **Cross-Validation (CV) Score**

## 📈 Results

The models performed well with an accuracy of **xx%**. The **Random Forest** classifier emerged as the best model with the highest **CV Score**.

### Model Performance

| Model                | Accuracy | CV Score |
|----------------------|----------|----------|
| Logistic Regression   | 72%      | 76%      |
| Decision Tree         | 75%      | 78%      |
| Random Forest         | 79%      | 80%      |
